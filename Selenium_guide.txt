Locating elements
	
	Model html:
	<input type="text" name="searchbox" id="someUniqueId" />

	Search input:
	element = driver.find_element_by_id("someUniqueId")
	element = driver.find_element_by_name("searchbox")
	element = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//input[@id='someUniqueId']")
	
	
Sending interaction instructions, such as setting text,
	selecting a radio box, and hitting ‘RETURN’ (on the keyboard), can be achieved using the ‘sendkeys’ method:	
	
	element.send_keys("Set some text")
	

In addition to sending text, we can also send keystrokes, individually or combined, with the text.

	element.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)
	element.send_keys("Set text", Keys.ARROW_DOWN)



Working with forms

In the following example we are searching a select control for the value ‘Ms’and,
when we find it, we are clicking it to select it:

	element = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//select[@name='Salutation']")
	all_options = element.find_elements_by_tag_name("option")
	for option in all_options:
		if option.get_attribute("value") == "Ms":
			option.click()

The final part of working with forms is knowing how to send the data in the form back to the server.
	This is achieved by either locating the submit button and sending a click event,
	or selecting any control within the form and calling ‘submit’ against that:

	driver.find_element_by_id("SubmitButton").click()

	someElement = driver.find_element_by_name("searchbox")
	someElement.submit()
